# linux-gaokun-buildbot

Build scripts, patches, kernel config, DTS files, tools, and firmware for Linux images targeting the Huawei MateBook E Go 2023 (`gaokun3` / `SC8280XP`).

The image pipeline now uses `systemd-boot` by default and can optionally build a second EL2 kernel variant with `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-gaokun3-el2"`.

## What is included

- `patches/`: kernel patches and device support changes
- `defconfig/`: local kernel configuration used by CI/manual builds
- `drivers/`: local mirrors of the patched driver sources kept in the patch series
- `dts/`: local mirrors of the patched device tree sources kept in the patch series
- `firmware/`: minimal firmware bundle used by the image build
- `packaging/`: RPM spec templates for kernel and firmware packages
- `tools/`: device-specific helper scripts, service files, and EL2 EFI payloads
- `scripts/ci/`: workflow build, image creation, and packaging scripts

The package pipeline builds and installs dedicated package sets:

- **Fedora (RPM)**: `kernel-gaokun3`, `kernel-modules-gaokun3`, `kernel-devel-gaokun3`, `linux-firmware-gaokun3`
- **Ubuntu (DEB)**: `linux-image-gaokun3`, `linux-modules-gaokun3`, `linux-headers-gaokun3`, `linux-firmware-gaokun3`
- **Optional EL2 variants**: `*-gaokun3-el2` package set for the second EL2 kernel build
